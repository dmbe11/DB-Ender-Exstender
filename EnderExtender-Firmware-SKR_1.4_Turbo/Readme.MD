About this firmware

Created for Ender Extender users

All firmware is compiled using the second extruder port as a second Z motor port.  
You don't have to use the feature but in the future if you add a dual z kit, plug it into the E1 driver port.

Two folders:

BLTOUCH
All firmware compiled with BLTouch and Bilinear bed levelling
Use the Z endstop switch port, not the BLTouch probe port.

NO_BLTOUCH
Standard Endstop switch on the Z port, Mesh bed levelling (manual)

BLTOUCH enabled firmware is also Dual Z Stepper alignment enabled.  Stepper Alignment feature require a probe.
